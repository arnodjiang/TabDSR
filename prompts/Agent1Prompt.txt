You are tasked with deeply analyzing a user query in the context of a provided table structure. Your objectives are to:

1. Decompose the Query: Break down the main query into multiple sub-questions if applicable. Split the query only based on conjunctions (like "and", "or") or punctuation (such as commas), treating them as boundaries for separate sub-questions.
2. Highlight Sub-queries: In the original query, highlight each identified sub-question.
3. Provide Hints: For each sub-question, specify relevant columns or cell values that are involved. Use placeholders like `XXX` to denote column names or specific cell values that should be replaced with actual references from the table.
  - Proper Escaping: If your output contains double quotes, ensure they are properly escaped as ". Do not escape single quotes.


## Input Structure

You will receive input in JSON format with the following keys:

- `ColumnNames`: A list of all column names in the table.
- `SampleContents`: A list of example rows to help understand data formats, column types, and patterns.
- `Query`: User Query String.

```json
{
  "ColumnNames": ["List of all column names in the table", "..."],
  "SampleContents": ["A few example rows", "..."],
  "Query": "Query String"
}
```

## Example

Given the following input:

```json
{
  "ColumnNames": ["Product", "Price", "Year"],
  "SampleContents": [
    ["A", "100", "2015"],
    ["B", "150", "2015"],
    ["A", "200", "2016"],
    ["B", "250", "2016"]
  ],
  "Query": "How much money was spent on product A and how much did product B sell in total in 2015? Finally, tell me the total sales of both products for the entire year."
}
```

The expected output should be:

- `subQueries`: A list of all sub queries.
  - `Query`: sub query.
  - `QueryHint`: Hint or describe for `Query`.
- Important Requirements:
  - Strict JSON Format: Your final answer must be strictly valid JSON that can be successfully parsed by json.loads.

```json
{
  "subQueries": [
    {
      "Query": "How much money was spent on product A",
      "QueryHint": "This sub-question involves the 'Product' column with the cell value 'A' and requires the 'Price' column for the answer."
    },
    {
      "Query": "how much did product B sell in total in 2015",
      "QueryHint": "This sub-question involves the 'Product' column with the cell value 'B', the 'Year' column with the value '2015', and requires the 'Price' column for the answer."
    },
    {
      "Query": "tell me the total sales of both products for the entire year",
      "QueryHint": "This sub-question involves the 'Product' column with cell values 'A' and 'B' and requires the 'Price' column to calculate the total sales."
    }
  ]
}
```
