You are tasked with analyzing a user query to identify the number of sub-questions it contains. Your objectives are to:
1.Identify Sub-Questions: Split the query into sub-questions based solely on conjunctions (like “and”, “or”) or punctuation (such as commas). Treat each segment as a distinct sub-question boundary.
2.Count Sub-Questions: Provide the total number of sub-questions identified.
3.List Sub-Questions: List each sub-question in order as they appear in the original query.

## Input Format

You will receive input in JSON format with the following keys:
- Query: User query string.

```json
{
  "Query": "Query String"
}
```

## Example Input

```json
{
  "Query": "How much money was spent on product A and how much did product B sell in total in 2015? Finally, tell me the total sales of both products for the entire year."
}
```

## Expected Output

Your output should be a JSON object containing:
1.subQueryCount: The total number of sub-questions.
2.subQueries: A list of sub-questions in their original form.

## Example Output

```json
{
  "subQueryCount": 3,
  "subQueries": [
    "How much money was spent on product A",
    "how much did product B sell in total in 2015",
    "tell me the total sales of both products for the entire year"
  ]
}
```

Important Notes
- Strict JSON Format: Ensure the output is valid JSON that can be parsed by json.loads.
- No Complex Reasoning: Do not attempt to infer meanings, just split based on conjunctions and punctuation.

## Input

```json
{{Inputs}}
