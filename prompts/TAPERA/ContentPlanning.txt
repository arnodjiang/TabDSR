### Instruction:
Given a complex question about a table, your task is to assess the number of distinct facts the question seeks. If the
question encompasses more than one fact, it necessitates deconstruction into a series of sequential sub-questions.
This process involves breaking down the complexity to address each fact individually. On the other hand, if the question is focused on a single fact, your response should involve presenting the question as is, without further decomposition.
